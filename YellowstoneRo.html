            <p>Since 2018, adventure photographer Nicholas J.R. White has been documenting this place; his work was recently featured in The New York Times. Looking at some of his photos without context, you might think you’re looking at a quintessential shot of a park in the American West. Members of Romania’s FCC are aware of the land’s beauty and determined to help it reach its potential.</p>
            <p>As darkness descends in Romania’s Făgăraș Mountains and we contemplate closing the curtains of the hide, a brown bear with an impeccable sense of drama appears, treating its audience to a late, late show. Half the size of a full-grown adult but still big enough to make me grateful for the pane of glass between us, it wanders the clearing in the forest, snout alternately lowered to the wet soil or raised to the cool air.</p>
            <p>Moments after our first visitor disappears into the deepening gloom, a second arrives with a flourish. The stag comes closer, the branching crown of his antlers bowed to the rain-sodden earth just a few metres away. He’s still there – invisible but for a patch of white fur – when we surrender to the failing light, lower our binoculars and retire for a midnight supper.</p>
            <p>If the evening’s wildlife watching is a lesson in how to build tension, the morning after is rush hour in the Carpathians of Transylvania. While the dawn chorus builds to a climax, we see two more bears – one large, one small – and a wild boar as stout as a pygmy hippo pass through this crossroads of secret, scent-laden thoroughfares.</p>
            <p>Bumping back down the unmetalled road to civilisation a few hours later, we meet a logger’s tractor blocking the way. With a roar, it shunts splintered trunks of spruce out of the road. As we pass, the sight of all that timber, and the mountainside from which it came, now evokes a feeling of disgust.
            <p>The last places that are wild and have these beautiful animals become so valuable that we have to protect them for all of Europe,' says our host Christoph Promberger, acknowledging his adversary in the tractor with a nod as he slip-slides his Izuzu pickup down the upper Dâmboviţa Valley.</p>
            <p>Romania is one of the continent’s last wild places: of the countries in the EU, it boasts the most virgin forest, the largest unfragmented forest, the highest level of biodiversity, and the most large carnivores – bears, lynx and wolves, the last of which lured Christoph here from his native Germany.</p>
